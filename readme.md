# Mongo Scraper

### Overview

A Mongo/Mongoose assignment where I was tasked with creating a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. Instead of scraping a news website, I decided to scraped thread links from my favorite game community on reddit, Monster Hunter World reddit sub.
